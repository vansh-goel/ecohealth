# EcoHealth+

EcoHealth+ is a project created during ImpactHack 2023, where we developed a web application that is designed to promote urban eco-development and sustainable living. It offers a range of features to educate and engage users in environmental conservation and sustainable practices.

## Description

EcoHealth+ aims to empower urban communities with the knowledge and tools to create greener, more sustainable environments. The application serves as a comprehensive resource for learning about various plants, their benefits, and how to grow them sustainably. It also provides an interactive platform for community engagement and feedback.

## Features

- **Interactive Map:** Explore micro-green spaces in urban areas and understand their impact on the environment.
- **Plant Database:** A detailed database of plants, including their benefits and tips for sustainable growth.
- **Event Calendar:** Stay informed about upcoming environmental events like workshops, clean-ups, and planting days.
- **Feedback System:** Users can share feedback, experiences, and suggestions for eco-development.

## How to Run the App

To run EcoHealth+ on your local machine, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/viditpok/ecohealth.git
   cd ecohealth
   ```
2. **Install Dependencies:**
   ```
   npm install
   ```
3. **Run the Application:**
   ```
   npm start
   ```
   
This will run the app in development mode. Open http://localhost:3000 (unless the port is already being used, for which the 3000 would be a different number) to view it in the browser. The page will reload if you make edits.
